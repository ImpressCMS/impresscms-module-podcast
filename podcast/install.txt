A manual is available
=====================

A manual for operation of Podcast is included in the podcast/extras folder. Read it!

How to install Podcast
=============================

Podcast is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete
/podcast folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as
administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Podcast icon in the list of
uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll
be ready to go.

The module is designed to be zero configuration; you can start publishing soundtracks immediately
on install, though of course you will probably want to customise the programmes/albums to suit
your own purpose.

Improving image loading speed (optional extra)
==============================================

Podcast uses the resize_image Smarty plugin to dynamically resize images when you change the image
size display preferences. Resized images are cached in /cache/uploads/podcast/, but the current
version of this plugin doesn't accessed the cached copies, it rebuilds images on each page load.

A fixed version of the plugin by Nachenko is included in the /modules/podcast/extras folder. Install
this file (function.resized_image.php) in the folder below, overwriting the old version, and the
cache problem will be resolved:

/libraries/smarty/icms_plugins/

The fixed version of the plugin has been committed and will appear in a future release of ICMS.
